# Traffic Accident Severity Prediction and Sociological Analysis

This project, developed collaboratively by **Nursena TaÅŸkÃ¶prÃ¼** and **Kerem Okur**, investigates and predicts the severity of traffic accidents using two diverse datasets: one from the United States and one from Addis Ababa. The analysis integrates machine learning models with sociological factors to draw comparative insights.

## Contents
- `ABD_KazalarÄ±.ipynb`: Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and ML modeling for the US dataset.
- `Addis_Ababa_KazalarÄ±.ipynb`: EDA and ML analysis for the Ethiopian dataset.
- `Poster.pdf` _(optional)_: Scientific poster summarizing the findings.
- `Research_Paper.pdf` _(optional)_: Academic paper detailing the methodology and results.

---

##  Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression
- **Sociological Analysis**: Correlation of demographic and environmental factors

---

## Objectives
1. Predict the severity of traffic accidents using classification models.  
2. Compare accident dynamics between two different regions (US vs. Addis Ababa).  
3. Examine sociological variables affecting accident outcomes.

---

## Key Findings
- **Feature Importance:** Driver behavior, weather conditions, and road infrastructure are critical predictors in both datasets.
- **Regional Differences:** The US dataset has extensive feature availability, while the Addis Ababa dataset required additional data cleaning and imputation strategies.
- **Sociological Impact:** Demographic factors (age, gender) and environmental variables (time of day, road type) show different degrees of influence on accident severity across regions.
